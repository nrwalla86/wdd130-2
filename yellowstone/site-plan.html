        I want to have a main page for my website to include some information on Yellowstone and all of the different sights 
        and things that you can do in the park. I am going to have content such as the text below including images for each page.

          Home Page

          Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872 and was the first national park established
        in the United States. The park is known for the many animals and different wild life in the area and has 
        other attractions such as the Old Faithful geyser. Some of the animals that you can look forward to seeing 
        in the park include bison, elk, bears and wolves.
          Some beautiful sights to visit may include places such as the Old Faithful geyser, the Grand Prismatic Spring,
        Mammoth Hot Springs and more. There are also campgrounds and fishing available for those with a fishing license 
        to fish. Yellowstone is an amazing place for all to visit and is home to some of the most beautiful sights and 
        animals so it is great for tourists and photographers!

        Fort Yellowstone

          Fort Yellowstone is a part of the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District and has 35 buildings that are still standing from the 1890's and 1900's. 
        These buildings are the first administrative and concession facilities in the park. The fort first started building structures when the park needed
        protection. More and more buildings started to be built when more troops were needed. These included quarters, a guard house, barracks and so on. At
        the peak of the Army's troops, there were 324 soldiers. These troops were stationed in Fort Yellowstone and other various places throughout the park. 
        The army was completely moved out of Yellowstone in 1918 and since then, the fort was the headquarters for Yellowstone. 

        Camping

          Yellowstone National Park has 12 campgrounds where you can go and enjoy the outdoors and beautiful scenery. These campsites must be reserved, 
        but the Mammoth Campground offers first-come, first-served. All of the campgrounds are the Bridge Bay, Canyon, Fishing Bridge RV Park, Grant Village,
        Madison, Indian Creek, Lewis Lake, Mammoth, Norris, Pebble Creek, Slough Creek, and Tower Fall Campgrounds. Some of these campgrounds are near places 
        such as the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River which offer amazing views and sights to see.
