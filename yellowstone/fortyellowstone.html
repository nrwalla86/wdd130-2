                    Fort Yellowstone is a part of the Mammoth Hot Springs Historic District and has 35 buildings that are still standing from the 1890's and 1900's. 
                These buildings are the first administrative and concession facilities in the park. The fort first started building structures when the park needed
                protection. More and more buildings started to be built when more troops were needed. These included quarters, a guard house, barracks and so on. At
                the peak of the Army's troops, there were 324 soldiers. These troops were stationed in Fort Yellowstone and other various places throughout the park. 
                The army was completely moved out of Yellowstone in 1918 and since then, the fort was the headquarters for Yellowstone.
